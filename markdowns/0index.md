Marcin Abram, based in London, UK, is a theoretical physicist and machine learning engineer.

In 2011-2016 he was a research assistant in a group lead by Prof. Józef Spałek at Jagiellonian University in Poland. He worked on coherence in quantum materials and structures. He has published 7 articles in leading scientific journals.


Since 2016 he has worked in TypeScore startup in London as the machine learning engineer, building technology to find, extract and analyse publicly available data on businesses, generating risk scores for every registered company in the UK.

He went on to study interdisciplinary natural and mathematical sciences at the undergraduate level and received an MS in Physics from the Jagiellonian University (UJ) in Kraków in 2011. Additionally, he completed his BS in Computer Science in 2012 and in 2016 he finished his PhD study in Theoretical Physics.

Marcin's research interests have translated into several educational initiatives. He re-started and re-vamped the dormant JU program for gifted high school students, introducing high-level physics and mathematics to selected students and providing them with an opportunity not offered in Polish schools. This resulted in several students achieving finalist status in the Polish National Physics Olympiad and many other competitive successes on the local and national level. On the university level, Marcin has taught statistical physics for two consecutive years, as well as introductory physics courses for non-physics majors. He also volunteers with the Education Center for Children with Visual Disabilities in Kraków, teaching math.

Marcin's experience with computer applications ranges from high performance computing and algorithm optimization to data analysis and machine learning.

He is an active member of the Python community. He helped with the organization of the PyData London 2018 Conference. He also volunteered as an instructor during the Python Data 2018 Science Beginners Bootcamp, where he led a session about Natural Language Processing
