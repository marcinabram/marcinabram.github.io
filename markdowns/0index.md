Marcin Abram, based in London, UK, is a theoretical physicist and machine learning engineer.

From 2011 to 2016, Marcin was a PhD candidate and research assistant in the theoretical condensed matter physics group led by Prof. Józef Spałek at Jagiellonian University (Krakow, Poland). He also earned a BS in Computer Science. Marcin's work examined coherence in quantum materials and structures, and he is the lead or co-author on 7 articles in leading scientific journals related to physics and computer science.

Since 2016, he has applied his computational and research skills as a machine learning engineer at TypeScore, a London-based startup. He builds technology to find, extract, and analyse data on businesses and generated novel risk scores for every registered company in the UK. Marcin’s experience with computer applications ranges from high performance computing and algorithm optimization to data analysis and machine learning.

Marcin is also an enthusiastic STEM educator, and  his research interests have translated into several educational initiatives. He re-started and re-vamped the dormant JU program for gifted high school students, introducing high-level physics and mathematics to selected students and providing them with an opportunity not offered in Polish schools. This resulted in several students achieving finalist status in the Polish National Physics Olympiad and many other competitive successes on the local and national level. On the university level, Marcin taught statistical physics for two years, as well as introductory physics courses for non-physics majors. He also volunteered with the Education Center for Children with Visual Disabilities in Kraków, teaching math.

He is an active member of the Python community in London. He volunteered as an organizer for the PyData London 2018 Conference. He led a session about Natural Language Processing at the Python Data 2018 Science Beginners Bootcamp.

Specialties: Quantum Physics, Programming (Python, C++, R), Statistics, Mathematical Modeling, High Performance Computing, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Bayesian Methods, Agile Methodologies, Linux, Teaching, Scientific Research.
