As a Postdoctoral Scholar - Teaching Fellow at <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/">the University of Southern California (USC)</a> and a Visiting Researcher at <a href="https://www.isi.edu/ai/">the Information Sciences Institute (ISI)</a>, my research focuses on developing innovative federated training protocols and exploring the applications of machine learning for scientific concept discovery. I am also committed to ethical and responsible AI, which is reflected in my critical examination of AI safety, model robustness, and methods for neural network interpretability.

In my current role, I leverage my background in physics and machine learning to investigate fundamental aspects of machine learning models' learning processes. To give some examples, below I showcase three recentrly completed projects.
 1. **Research on generalization in deep learning.** 
 In 2020-2022, I co-directed a research group of five members to investigate how neural networks acquire knowledge from training examples and generalize that knowledge to handle out-of-distribution cases. We designed a learning framework that enabled knowledge distillation from a physically-informed emulator, successfully applying this schema to learn the general rules of one-dimensional quantum dynamics. Our neural network was able to generalize the acquired knowledge and emulate wave propagation through an arbitrarily complex potential landscape, while being trained only on simpler examples of tunelling through a single rectangular barier. Our work was recognized in a submission to the <i>Characteristic Science Applications</i> effort of the NSF’s Leadership Class Computing Facility (LCCF) program, reaching the final round of the competition, outperforming 125 other applications. In addition, one of my students was able to use this work as a core part of his Ph.D. thesis, successfully finishing his program and receiving a doctoral degree. To learn more, check our recently published <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmats.2022.1060744">article in the Frontiers in Materials</a> journal.
 2. **Research on scientific knowledge discovery using machine learning.**
 Another one of my projects was completed in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory. In response to the needs of our research partners, I proposed a self-supervised learning schema to determine how changes in process parameters influence the final outcome of a physical vapor deposition process. This work has a potential broad implications both in the materials science research and in the industry, as it allows to optimize manufacturing processes of functional materials synthesis. Our research was recognized with a sponsored research award from the Department of Energy. We have recently published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00889-2">our results in the prestigious _npj_ Computational Materials</a> (a Nature-partner journal).
 3. **Research on novel protocols for federated learning.**
 Finally, I am also a research member of the SHELFI project (part of the DARPA Cooperative Secure Learning initiative). In this project, I focus on improving the quality of federated training procedures in a limit of a non-IID data distribution and with a presence of honest-but-forgetful participants. Through the development of an elastic-weight consolidation schema, my team and I demonstrated improved accuracy compared to a baseline approach that simply ignores corrupted updates. Through this work, my research aims to understand the fundamental aspects of machine learning models' learning processes, including how knowledge is stored and combined, and how to efficiently learn from noisy or partially corrupted examples. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01184">A pre-print describing this work is available at arXiv</a>.

Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Scholar - Teaching Fellow at the University of Southern California (USC) and I hold a secondary role as a Visiting Researcher at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI). My research focuses on developing novel federated training protocols and exploring applications of machine learning in scientific concept discovery. My work also considers critical questions around AI safety, model robustness, and neural network interpretability, reflecting my commitment to ethical and responsible AI.
 
As a physicist and machine learning scientist, I combine my knowledge of those two fields in my current research.
Below, I showcast some of my recently completed projects.

 1. **Research on generalization in deep learning.** I run a research group (5&nbsp;members), where we investigate how neural networks acquire knowledge from training examples. We are interested in building physically-informed neural networks for solving various dynamical physical processes. We approached it by designing learning frameworks that facilitate knowledge distillation from physically-informed emulators. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully applied that schema to learn general rules of one-dimensional quantum dynamics from a set of simple examples. We restricted the training only to instances featuring particle tunneling through a single rectangular potential barrier. Our neural network was able to learn Schr&#246;dinger's wave mechanics from those training examples and correctly generalize the acquired knowledge to emulate propagation through an arbitrary complex potential landscape.
 2. **Research on scientific knowledge discovery via machine learning.** I work in a group (4&nbsp;members) where we investigate how to learn the role of control parameters in regulating complex, dynamical processes. I proposed a self-supervised learning schema that allows us to characterize the control parameters and determine how they influence the outcome of the physical process. We applied this method to investigate the role of parameters controlling the two-dimensional physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. This work has far-reach implications, as it might help in optimizing a thin-film production or can aid researchers looking for new functional materials.
 3. **Research on novel protocols for federated learning.** The goal is to improve the quality of the federated training procedure in the regime of non-IID data distributions and under the assumption of honest-but-forgetful participants. We approached it by proposing a novel elastic-weight consolidation schema that demote contributions from corrupted agents. We were able to show that our schema leads to better accuracy than an alternative method that ignores the corrupted examples. It means, that the community model in our scheme can benefit from the partially corrupted updates while being robust to a certain class of mistakes (e.g., label shuffling or label flipping).
