I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Scholar&ndash;Teaching Fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Southern California (USC). I am also a Visiting Researcher at the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI).

My research concerns fundamental aspects of machine learning as well as its applications in various domains. I am currently involved in the following projects:
 1. **Research on generalization in deep learning.** I run a research group (5&nbsp;members), where we investigate how neural networks acquire knowledge from training examples. We are interested in building physically-informed neural networks for solving various dynamical physical processes. We approached it by designing learning frameworks that facilitate knowledge distillation from physically-informed emulators. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully applied that schema to learn general rules of one-dimensional quantum dynamics from a set of simple examples. We restricted the training only to instances featuring particle tunneling through a single rectangular potential barrier. Our neural network was able to learn Schr&#246;dinger's wave mechanics from those training examples and correctly generalize the acquired knowledge to emulate propagation through an arbitrary complex potential landscape.
 2. **Research on scientific knowledge discovery via machine learning.** I work in a group (4&nbsp;members) where we investigate how to learn the role of control parameters in regulating complex, dynamical processes. I proposed a self-supervised learning schema that allows us to characterize the control parameters and determine how they influence the outcome of the physical process. We applied this method to investigate the role of parameters controlling the two-dimensional physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. This work has far-reach implications, as it might help in optimizing a thin-film production or can aid researchers looking for new functional materials.
 3. **Research on novel protocols for federated learning.** The goal is to improve the quality of the federated training procedure in the regime of non-IID data distributions and under the assumption of honest-but-forgetful participants. We approached it by proposing a novel elastic-weight consolidation schema that demote contributions from corrupted agents. We were able to show that our schema leads to better accuracy than an alternative method that ignores the corrupted examples. It means, that the community model in our scheme can benefit from the partially corrupted updates while being robust to a certain class of mistakes (e.g., label shuffling of label flipping).

In 2016 I received my doctorate in Theoretical Physics from <a href="https://en.uj.edu.pl/en">Jagiellonian University</a>. In addition, to my physics education, I also hold a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and I have four years of work experience as a machine learning engineer and research scientist in the tech-sector (see the details in the <a href="CV">CV section</a>).

My training, as well as my research and teaching interests, are in learning theory, machine learning methods, multi-body dynamical systems, distributed and decentralized protocols. My empirical interests lie in interdisciplinary applications of machine learning and physics (especially in the fields of condensed matter and material science).
