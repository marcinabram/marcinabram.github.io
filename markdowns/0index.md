I am currently working as a Lead Research Scientist at <a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.AI</a>. In 2016 I received my doctorate in Theoretical Physics from <a href="https://en.uj.edu.pl/en">Jagiellonian University</a>. In addtition to my physical education I also hold a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science. From 2016 to 2018, I worked as a machine learning engineer and research scientist in London and Cambridge, UK. In January 2019, I was promoted to Lead Research Scientist, and in that capacity I relocated to New Haven, CT, USA to establish for Fetch.AI an overseas research unit focused on academic collaborations in blockchain and machine learning.

My training, as well as my research and teaching interests are in computational techniques, statistical methods, data analysis, machine learning algorithms, multi-agent systems, emergent behaviors and decentralized protocols. My empirical interests lie in interdisciplinary applications of data science techniques in physical and economic systems using both analytic and numerical methods. My primary research agenda applies theoretical insights from physics (i.e., emergent behavior and self-organization) and economics (i.e., mechanism design) to study decentralized systems. I have a second research agenda applying machine learning to solve optimization problems in materials science.

My current research agenda includes consensus design (in the context of decentralized protocols), machine learning applications in multi-agent systems, and blockchain governance (both on- and off-chain). In terms of the consensus design, I am one of the main co-author of a novel protocol that aims to limit the one-shot monopoly of round-leaders.

I'm working for [Fetch.AI](https://fetch.ai/) as a Lead Research Scientist. My research focuses on consensus protocols, economic limits of blockchains, systems design and machine learning applications in distributed systems. Recently I moved to New Haven, CT, to set up a new US research unit for my company.

Previously I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at TypeScore, a London-based fintech startup. I was their first employee and the main developer. In two years we created a technology to find, extract, and analyse data on businesses that surpassed the existing state-of-the-art solutions.

Between 2011 and 2016 worked as a research assistant in the theoretical condensed matter physics group led by [Prof. Józef Spałek](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Spa%C5%82ek). I was a team member in two national grants and I published seven articles in world-class scientific journals. In my work, I focused on developing approximated methods of solving complex, multi-body quantum systems.

Specialized knowledge: Distributed Ledger Technologies, Blockchain Design, Consensus Protocols, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Bayesian Models, Artificial Neural Networks, Physics, Theory of Magnetism and Superconductivity, High-Performance Computing, Scientific Research, Academic Teaching.
