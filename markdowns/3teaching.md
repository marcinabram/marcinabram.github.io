I developed my teaching philosophy in several contexts.Â My first classroom experience involved teaching gifted high school students. The classes were intended to prepare students for the National Physics and Astronomy Olympiads.
Several students reached the finalist level of the Olympiad competition (i.e., ranked in the top 100 nationally) in the National Physics Olympiad and one student received the silver medal won on the 7th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IAOO 2013) in Volos, Grece.

I also have experience teaching courses at the university level, both on the undergraduate and graduate levels. At the Jagiellonian University, I taught freshman-level class, <i>Physics with Biophysics Elements</i> for Environmental Studies majors students and <i>Statistical Physics</i>.
The student evaluated my classes at 4.88/5.0 and 4.97/5.0 with the annual university averages 4.40 and 4.36 respectively. At the University of Southern California, I taught PHYS-304 <i>Mechanics</i> and DSCI-552 <i>Machine Learning for Data Science</i>. Given my unique experience, combining physics and computer science, I also supervised a number of senior projects from Physics/Computer Science majors.
