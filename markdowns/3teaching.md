I have developed my teaching skills both in a university setting and in my community. I have extensive experience in preparing lectures and tutorials, teaching both large and small classes. During my PhD, I revitalized and led a course for high school students on advanced physics topics and numerical methods. Many of my students went on to be competitive participants in regional, national and international competitions (one our student got a silver medal on 7th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, others obtained several finalist titles in the National Physics Olympiad).

At the university, I taught several undergraduate-level courses, including Statistical Physics recitation sessions for third-year physics undergraduates. Students evaluated my teaching skills as superior, namely at 4.88/5.0 in 2013 and at 4.97/5.0 in 2014, while the annual university averages were 4.40 and 4.36 respectively.

I make an effort to be an active member of my local and academic community. I helped with the organization of the PyData London 2018 Conference. I also volunteered as an instructor during the recent Python Data Science Beginners Bootcamp, where I led a session about Natural Language Processing. Last year, I was invited back to my home department to give a talk about machine learning and potential applications to physics research.

Since 2018 I regularly review articles for Journal of Physics: Material and New Journal of Physics related to such topics as an application of machine learning in physics, neural networks, scientific computing, magnetism and novel materials [(cf. my profile on publons)](https://publons.com/researcher/1594724/marcin-abram/).
