I hold an M.Sc. (5-year Master Program) and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics. In addition to my physics education, I also got a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science. From 2016 to 2020, I worked as a machine learning engineer and scientist in London and Cambridge, UK. Currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral Scholar-Teaching Fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Southern California (USC) with a second appointment at the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) as a Visiting Researcher.
