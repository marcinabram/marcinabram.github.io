With a Ph.D. in theoretical and computational physics, and with an additional B.Sc. in computer science, I possess a strong background in computational methods and machine learning. Building on my four years of industry experience as a machine learning engineer and scientist, I have continued to pursue my research interests in machine learning as a postdoctoral researcher. Currently, I hold a position as a Postdoctoral Scholar - Teaching Fellow at the University of Southern California (USC), and a secondary role as a Visiting Researcher at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI). My research focuses on developing innovative federated training protocols and exploring machine learning's potential applications in scientific research.
<!--
Additionally, I am committed to investigating critical questions around AI safety, such as model robustness or neural network interpretability, to ensure ethical and responsible AI development.
-->
My work also considers critical questions around AI safety, model robustness, and neural network interpretability, reflecting my commitment to ethical and responsible AI.

<!--
My training and work experience are in computational methods, machine learning, statistical and quantum physics, as well as distributed and decentralized protocols.
I hold a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and an additional B.Sc. in computer science. With 4 years of experience as a machine learning engineer and scientist in the industry, followed by 3 years of postdoctoral research, I possess a strong background in computational methods and machine learning.

My empirical interests lie in interdisciplinary applications of machine learning and physics (especially in the fields of condensed matter and materials science).
