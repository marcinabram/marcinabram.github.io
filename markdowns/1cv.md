With a Ph.D. in theoretical and computational physics, and with an additional B.Sc. in computer science, I possess a strong background in computational methods and machine learning. Building on my four years of industry experience as a machine learning engineer and scientist, I have continued to pursue my research interests in machine learning as a postdoctoral researcher. Currently, I hold a position as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California (USC), and a secondary role as a Visiting Researcher at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI). My research focuses on developing innovative federated training protocols and exploring machine learning's potential applications in scientific research.
