Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to develop my teaching philosophy in a variety of settings. My first classroom experience was in 2012, where I taught gifted high school students to prepare them for the National Physics and Astronomy Olympiads. My efforts resulted in several of my students reaching the finalist level (i.e., being ranked top 100 nationally) and one student winning a silver medal on the 7th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IAOO 2013) in Volos, Grece.

I developed my teaching philosophy in several contexts.
My first classroom experience in 2012 involved teaching gifted high school students. The classes were designed to prepare students for the National Physics and Astronomy Olympiads.
Several students reached the finalist level of the Olympiad competition (i.e., ranked in the top 100 nationally) in the National Physics Olympiad and one of my students received the silver medal won on the 7th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IAOO 2013) in Volos, Grece.

Since then, I have taught a range of courses at universities in Europe and the United States, including undergraduate and graduate courses in physics and data science programs. At Jagiellonian University, I taught freshman-level courses in <i>Physics with Biophysics Elements</i> for Environmental Studies majors and <i>Statistical Physics</i> for physics majors.
My teaching was well-received by students, with evaluations averaging 4.88/5.0 in 2013 and 4.97/5.0 in 2014, surpassing the annual university averages of 4.40 and 4.36, respectively.

Since then, I had an opportunity of teaching both small and large courses at universities in Europe and USA, including core classes from physics and data science programs, both on the undergraduate and graduate levels. At the Jagiellonian University, I taught freshman-level class, <i>Physics with Biophysics Elements</i> for Environmental Studies majors students, and <i>Statistical Physics</i> offered to physics majors.
The student evaluated my classes at 4.88/5.0 in 2013 and 4.97/5.0 in 2014, with the annual university averages being 4.40 and 4.36 respectively.

At the University of Southern California, I have taught a variety of courses including PHYS-304 <i>Mechanics</i>, DSCI-552 <i>Machine Learning for Data Science</i>, PHYS-151 <i>Fundamentals of Physics I: Mechanics and Thermodynamics</i> (a class of 120 students), PHYS-316 <i>Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics</i>, and PHYS-408 <i>Electricity and Magnetism</i>. Given my unique background in physics and computer science, I have also supervised several senior projects for Physics/Computer Science majors in my department.

At the University of Southern California, for three consecutive years I taught PHYS-304 <i>Mechanics</i>, an upper-division undergraduate class that can be regarded as an introduciton to theoretical physics. In addition to that, in 2021 I taught DSCI-552 <i>Machine Learning for Data Science</i>, in 2022 PHYS-151 <i>Fundamentals of Physics I: Mechanics and Thermodynamics</i>, and in 2023 PHYS-316 <i>Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics</i>. Given my unique experience, combining physics and computer science, I also supervised a number of senior projects from Physics/Computer Science majors.
