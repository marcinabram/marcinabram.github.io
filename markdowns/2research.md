In my doctoral research, I focused on mathematical modeling and developing a numerical method for solving strongly correlated fermion problems. In particular, I was responsible for the development of methods and software for estimating the ground state energy of strongly correlated materials and for modeling classical and quantum phase transitions in heavy-fermion systems. In that work, my additional education as a computer scientist proved to be relevant, as my tasks required algorithm optimization, computations at the university’s supercomputer and non-trivial data analysis and interpretation.

My current research agenda includes consensus design (in the context of decentralized protocols), machine learning applications in multi-agent systems, and blockchain governance (both on- and off-chain). In terms of the consensus design, I am one of the main co-author of a novel protocol that aims to limit the one-shot monopoly of round-leaders. This preliminary work shows that the protocol might enhance security by preventing or reducing scale of some attacks (like an <i>undercutting attack</i> or <i>Flash Boys 2.0</i>).

Another project in which I am involved regards applications of machine learning techniques in physics. The goal of that project is to investigate methods that can be used to estimate the physical characteristics of organic molecules. Using a variational autoencoder, it is possible to calculate molecular-embedding and used it to estimate selected physical characteristics of new molecules. We plan to move beyond these initial point estimates to use Bayesian methods to model the uncertainty of these predictions. This development would help researchers search for candidate-molecules with particularly extreme physical properties.
